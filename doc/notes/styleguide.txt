Headers
-------
- The first line of a header should be "#pragma once".
- Then #include any system headers, sorted alphabetically.
- Then #include any Finch headers, sorted alphabetically.
- Only #include headers that are needed by the header itself. Prefer
  forward declarations when possible.

Type Names
----------
There are two logical "kinds" of types we care about: value types and
reference types. Value types are primitive types, or types that act
like primitive types. They are:
  1) Small in size
  2) Copyable
  3) Not polymorphic
  
All other types are reference types. Value types are named using
camelCase, to make them appear similar to primitive types like "int".
Reference types are named using PascalCase.

Arguments
---------
- Pass value types by value unless the called function needs to
  modify the caller's view of it.
- Pass reference types by const reference if:
  1) the function will not modify it
  2) the function will not store it
  3) the function cannot accept NULL
- Pass reference types by reference if:
  1) the function will modify it
  2) the function will not store it
  3) the function cannot accept NULL
- Pass reference types by const pointer if:
  1) the function will not modify it
  2) the function will not store it
  3) the function can accept NULL
- Pass reference types by pointer if:
  1) the function will modify it
  2) the function will not store it
  3) the function can accept NULL
- Pass reference types by ref<T> if:
  1) the function will store the reference
