Finch is two things simultaneously: a small C++ program for me to
brush up on my low-level skills, and an interpreter for a simple
dynamic prototype-based language. I'm going to guess that you care
more about the latter, though the former may help explain some design
choices in the code (i.e. why I seem to be reinventing so many 
wheels).

Finch the language is heavily inspired by the Self programming
language. It's basically my attempt to take self and do two things to
it:

1. Make its syntax more familiar to someone coming from a typical
   curly and semicolon programming background.

2. Make it text friendly unlike most Smalltalk-derived languages.

In other words, Finch is a Smalltalk for the rest of us.

To give you a flavor of what the language looks like, here's some
samples:

    writeLine: "Hello, world!"
